      <h3>About me</h3>
        <p>
          After earning my B.S. in Chemistry at Cal Poly SLO in 1982, I stayed on
          the central coast and earned my teaching credential in 1984.  With no
          teaching jobs in the SLO area, I travelled back to L.A. and taught for
          a year at Hoover High School in Glendale.   That following summer, I was
          fortunate to run into Jack Rose while he was watering his lawn and learned
          about the opening at SM. Apparently, my predecessor resigned the day
          before.  I've been here ever since.
        </p>
      <h3>Hobbies</h3>
        <p>
          I love the outdoors.  On the weekend, if the sun is out, I'm hiking.
          I took the picture above when I visited the White Mountains and hiked
          through the Ancient Bristlecone Pine Forest, one the north side of Big
          Pine, CA.  The trail is a nice 4 mile loop that passes by the the
          Methuselah tree, found at 11,000 feet above sea level, and is 4,843
          years old.

          I love to find new recipes and try them out.  If I'm staring at my
          computer screen, I am likely to be looking at pictures of food either on
          <a href="http://foodgawker.com">foodgawker.com</a> or
          <a href="http://tastespotting.com">tastespotting.com</a> trying to find
          something new to cook for dinner.
        </p>
        <p>
          One afternoon a week, weather permitting, I'll be golfing.  I love the
          sound of a well struck ball, and of course, the sound of a putt dropping
          into the hole.
        </p>
